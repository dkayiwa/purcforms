# purcforms
Purcform adaptation and custom changes 

[Purcforms] is a GWT based form designer and form runtime engine. The form definitions are stored as xforms and the layout (position, size, etc) of input widgets (textboxes, buttons, etc) is stored in a custom XML format. One can use the form designer and form runtime engine separately. Incorporating any of the two in your application requires just referencing one JavaScript file and having a few other dependant files on your server. The form designer also has an html file that you can run in the browser without requiring a server.
